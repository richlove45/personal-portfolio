		<h2>About Me</h1>
			<p id="gurlllll"><strong>WELCOME KINGS AND QUEENS</strong>-- My name is Richlove Nkansah. I am Ghanian,Taurus and 15 years of age. I recently moved to the United States from Ghana. My time here as been great and I have been able to learn and experience more things here than when I was back in Africa. This is because I have free access to resources and it provides me with programs that are suitable for getting me where I need to be in life. I am the only female in my household, I have an eight year old brother who is very energetic, and always giving me advice. 
			I am a student at Bronx Health Sciences(BHS).
			I am an assiduous worker, I enjoy reading, and listening to music.
			I am funny at times, but my friends laugh at my jokes which makes me feel like a comedian. I got into the Code Next program when I was 14 years of age. I love it here because I am learning things that my classmates aren't learning, the Code Next program teaches me how to be a leader in my community, and how to use Javascript and CSS to create websites that represents as a whole. </p>
