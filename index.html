		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p id="gurlllll"><strong>WELCOME to my Personal Portfolio</strong>-- My name is Richlove Nkansah. I am Ghanian, and 15 years of age. I recently moved to the United States from Ghana about 5 years ago. My time here as been great. I have met amazing people all in which has shaped me to be the person I am today, and without them I would not be here. I am currently a sophmore at Bronx Health Sciences. I am an assiduous worker, I enjoy reading, and listening to music. I got into the Code Next program when I was 14 years of age. I love it here because I am learning things that brings me out of my comfort zone. The Code Next program is a program that works with Highschoolers mainly students from black, and Latinx background to raise up generational tech leaders. They help students become creative, computational thinkers, and to captivate every opportunity presented to them, while nurturing them to become leaders in their communities. The Code Next program taught me how to become a leader in my community, and how to use analytical skills to program HTML, Javascript, and CSS. This website is a portfolio about some projects I have created. </p>

				<p>"Love and Kindness are never wasted". I am interested in setting a good example for the genereation after me. I enjoy helping people, and giving back to my community.
				I like to play tennis during the summer. I am interested in exploring different things that the world has to offer. I work hard for what I want. Occasionally, I volunteer at Bay Park Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation Center during the week. I enjoy the little things in life such as the smile on people's face just by greeting them when I see them. Choose Kindness everyday and help make the world a better place. </p>
