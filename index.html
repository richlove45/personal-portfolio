		<h2>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is <strong>Richlove Nkansah</strong>, I am Ghanian,Taurus and 14 years of age. I recently moved to the United States from Ghana. My time here as been great and I have been able to acquire more knowledge here than when I was back in Africa, only becasue the edcuational system here is very rigorous and it provides me with programs that are suitable for getting me where I need to be educationally. I am the only female in my household, I have an eight year old brother who is very energetic, and always giving me advice. 
			I am a student at Bronx health Sciences(BHS).
			I am an assiduous worker, I enjoy reading, and listening to music.
			I am funny at times, but my friends laugh at my jokes which makes me feel like a comedian. </p>
